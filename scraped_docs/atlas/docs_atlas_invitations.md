# Invitations to Organizations and Projects - MongoDB Atlas


Docs Home / MongoDB Atlas / Configure UI Access / Authorization Invitations to Organizations and Projects On this page Accept Invitations to Join Organizations View Outgoing Invitations Important Project Invitation Deprecation The Atlas release on September 13, 2023 deprecates project
invitations. When you invite an organization member to projects within the
organization, the user is automatically granted access to
those projects and doesn't receive any invitations. When you invite a
user to projects in an organization that the user doesn't belong to,
the user receives a single invitation to the organization, which
includes access to all of the projects that you grant them access to.
Invitations expire after 30 days. Accept Invitations to Join Organizations The Invitations tab allows you to view and accept
pending invitations to Atlas organizations. To view pending invitations to join organizations: 1 Navigate to the Invitations page. In the upper right corner of the Atlas UI, click your
