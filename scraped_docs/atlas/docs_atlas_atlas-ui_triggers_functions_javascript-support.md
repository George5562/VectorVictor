syntax as well as most modern JavaScript features included in EcmaScript
2015 (ES6) and more recent releases. They can also access most Node.js
built-in modules.

Node built-in modules in Functions . Atlas Functions
support most built-ins with either full or partial support. Some
built-ins that are not suited for serverless workloads are not
supported. Note The supported modules and partially supported modules are compatible
with Node API version 10.18.1 . Avoid
using APIs in these modules introduced after or deprecated since Node
10.18.1. Fully Supported Modules Atlas Functions fully support the following built-in modules: assert buffer events net os path punycode Note The built-in punycode module is deprecated . However, Atlas Functions
provide the punycode module from npm automatically. You can import the module with: const punycode = require ( "punycode" ) ; querystring stream string_decoder timers tls tty url zlib Partially Supported Modules Atlas Functions support a subset of the functionality of the following modules. dgram Atlas Functions support the following dgram APIs: socket.addMembership socket.address socket.bind socket.close createSocket socket.dropMembership socket.send socket.setBroadcast socket.setMulticastLoopback socket.setMulticastTTL Atlas Functions do not support the following dgram APIs: socket.ref socket.setTTL socket.unref dns Atlas Functions support the dns module with the following exceptions : Atlas Functions do not support the dns Promises API Atlas Functions do not support resolver.cancel() fs Atlas Functions support the following fs APIs: accessSync constants lstatSync readFileSync statSync http , http/2 and https Atlas Functions support all of the http and https APIs except for the Server class functionality. Similarly, Atlas Functions support only the client-side APIs of http/2 . Note axios Supported for Sending HTTP Requests Atlas Functions support v1.3.6 of the HTTP library, axios . You can replace
HTTP requests sent through an HTTP Service client with calls to an HTTP library like axios. process Atlas Functions support the following process APIs: hrTime nextTick version versions util Atlas Functions support the util module with the following exceptions : Atlas Functions do not support util.TextEncoder Atlas Functions do not support util.TextDecoder crypto Atlas Functions support the crypto module with
the following exceptions : Atlas Functions do not support crypto.createDiffieHellman() Atlas Functions do not support crypto.createDiffieHellmanGroup() Atlas Functions do not support crypto.createECDH() Unsupported Modules Atlas Functions do not support the following built-in
modules: child_process cluster domain readline v8 vm Back Handle Errors Next Read
