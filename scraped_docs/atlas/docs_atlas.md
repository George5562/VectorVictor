# What is MongoDB Atlas? - MongoDB Atlas


What is MongoDB Atlas ? MongoDB Atlas is a multi-cloud database service by the same people
that build MongoDB. Atlas simplifies deploying and managing your
databases while offering the versatility you need to build resilient
and performant global applications on the cloud providers of your choice. Get Started What You Can Do Build with MongoDB on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud MongoDB Atlas makes it easy to deploy and manage databases
on-demand when and where you need them. Deploy a Database Secure your Database Connect to your Database Optimize your Database 1 Choose a cluster type. Play around with a free cluster, launch a serverless instance, or define a dedicated cluster
configuration for your application. To choose a deployment type, see Database Deployment Types . 2 Choose a Cloud Provider and Region Deploy your database to the same cloud provider and region as
your applications to reduce latency and standardize security
controls. To choose a cloud provider and region, see Cloud Providers and Regions . 3 Customize your cluster. Enable multi-cloud and multi-region data distribution to
expand global coverage, increase fault tolerance, and meet
data compliance requirements. To customize your cluster, see Configure High Availability and Workload Isolation . 1 Add IP Access List Entries Define an IP access list for your cluster.
Always-on authentication ensures only approved client
connections can access your database. To add IP Access List entries, see Configure IP Access List Entries . 2 Manage Database Users Define how your team members and applications authenticate
to your database and what data they can access. To manage database users, see Configure Database Users . 3 (Optional) Configure Private Network Access Configure peering connections or private endpoints for your
applications to connect to your databases for additional
