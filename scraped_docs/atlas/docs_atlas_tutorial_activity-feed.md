from the organization's creation to its deletion. Atlas CLI Atlas Administration API Atlas UI To return all events for an organization using the
Atlas CLI, run the following command: atlas events organizations list [options] To learn more about the command syntax and parameters, see the
Atlas CLI documentation for atlas events organizations list .

modify data in the Data Explorer in the Atlas UI.
Even though the Project Activity Feed will no longer log
usernames, it continues to log user connections from the Atlas UI
to a cluster. To track user activity, you can use database audit logs and create custom audit filters that isolate user activity associated with
the following system-generated Administrator roles unique to Data Explorer : { role: "atlasDataAccessReadWrite", db: "admin" } { role: "atlasDataAccessReadOnly", db: "admin" } { role: "atlasDataAccessAdmin", db: "admin" } For example, you could create a custom audit filter similar to the following: { "roles": { "$elemMatch": { "$or": [ { "role": "atlasDataAccessReadWrite", "db": "admin" }, { "role": "atlasDataAccessReadOnly", "db": "admin" }, { "role": "atlasDataAccessAdmin", "db": "admin" } ] } } } To learn more about audit logs and review specific examples of role filters,
