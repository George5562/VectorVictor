# $degreesToRadians (aggregation) - MongoDB Manual v8.0


Docs Home / MongoDB Manual / Aggregation Operations / Reference / Operators $degreesToRadians (aggregation) On this page Definition Behavior Example Definition $degreesToRadians Converts an input value measured in degrees to radians. $degreesToRadians has the following syntax: { $degreesToRadians : < expression > } $degreesToRadians takes any valid expression that resolves to a number. By default $degreesToRadians returns values as a double . $degreesToRadians can also return values
as a 128-bit decimal as long as the <expression> resolves to a 128-bit decimal value. For more information on expressions, see Expression Operators . Behavior null , NaN , and +/- Infinity If the argument resolves to a value of null or refers to a field
that is missing, $degreesToRadians returns null . If
the argument resolves to NaN , $degreesToRadians returns NaN . If the argument resolves to negative or positive
infinity, $degreesToRadians negative or positive infinity
respectively. Example Results { $degreesToRadians: NaN } NaN { $degreesToRadians: null } null { $degreesToRadians : Infinity} Infinity { $degreesToRadians : -Infinity } -Infinity Example The trigonometry collection contains a document that contains
three angles measured in degrees: { "angle_a" : NumberDecimal( "53.13010235415597870314438744090659" ) , "angle_b" : NumberDecimal( "36.86989764584402129685561255909341" ) , "angle_c" : NumberDecimal( "90" ) } The following aggregation operation uses the $degreesToRadians expression to convert each value to
its radian equivalent and add them to the input document using the $addFields pipeline stage. db.trigonometry.aggregate([ { $addFields : { "angle_a_rad" : { $degreesToRadians : " $angle_a " }, "angle_b_rad" : { $degreesToRadians : " $angle_b " }, "angle_c_rad" : { $degreesToRadians : " $angle_c " } } } ]) The operation returns the following document: { "_id" : ObjectId( "5c50aec71c75c59232b3ede4" ), "angle_a" : NumberDecimal( "53.13010235415597870314438744090660" ), "angle_b" : NumberDecimal( "36.86989764584402129685561255909341" ), "angle_c" : NumberDecimal( "90" ), "angle_a_rad" : NumberDecimal( "0.9272952180016122324285124629224290" ), "angle_b_rad" : NumberDecimal( "0.6435011087932843868028092287173227" ), "angle_c_rad" : NumberDecimal( "1.570796326794896619231321691639752" ) } Since angle_a , angle_b , and angle_c are stored as 128-bit decimals , the output of $degreesToRadians is a 128-bit decimal.
